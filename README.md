This repository contains my personal study notes and R code implementations developed during my Master's studies in Educational Measurement and Evaluation. 

## About this Repository
The goal of this project is to document my learning journey in R programming and statistical analysis. It includes various tutorials on descriptive statistics, data visualization, and data manipulation, specifically tailored for educational data.
