# 1. Measures of Central Tendency
Central tendency represents the single value that attempts to describe a set of data by identifying the central position within that set of data.

## Mean and Median
The **Mean** is the arithmetic average, and the **Median** is the middle score.

```{r}
# Student score dataset
student_scores <- c(65, 78, 82, 91, 74, 88, 95, 60, 84, 79)

# Calculating Central Tendency
mean(student_scores)
median(student_scores)
# Calculating Variability
sd(student_scores)
var(student_scores)
