# 1. System and Help Commands

These commands are used to manage your workspace and find information about R functions.



## ls() - List Objects

In measurement studies, you may work with multiple datasets. The `ls()` command lists all variables and objects currently stored in your environment.



## help() or ? - Access Documentation

if you are unsure how a function (like 'mean')works, you can access its official documentation.



## args() - Function Arguments

Before using a function, you might want to see what parameters it requires. args() provides a quick look at the function's arguments.



## print() - Displaying Output

While R often displays results automatically, print() is the formal way to show the content of an object.



## c() - Combine / Concatenate

This is the most frequently used function in R. It combines individual elements into a single vector (a list of numbers or text).



## seq() - Sequence Generation

This function is extremely useful for generating regular sequences of numbers, such as creating student IDs from 1 to 100.



```{r}

# Let's create a temporary variable

test_score <- 95



# List all objects in the environment

ls()



# Both commands do the same thing

help(mean)

# ?mean



# See the arguments for the mean function

args(mean)



message <- "Welcome to R Programming"

print(message)



# Combining student scores into a vector

student_scores <- c(85, 70, 92, 65, 88)

student_scores



# Create a sequence from 1 to 10

student_ids <- seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1)

student_ids



# Create a sequence with increments of 5

increments <- seq(0, 50, 5)

increments
